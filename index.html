            <p>Every one of us has some kind of liking/ disliking for certain things in life. Similarly I love drawing because drawing is so much fun.I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. I like drawing since I was 5 years oldI like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. Drawing is the perfect way to make things look alive. I imagine all kinds of strange things to show it on a piece of paper such as demons, cute things, a beautiful house in heaven etc. </p>
